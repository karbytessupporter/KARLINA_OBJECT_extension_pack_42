On 13_JUNE_2025, I went to the court session in Dublin, California which I submitted a petition for (requesting the expungement of misdemeanors from my criminal record so that my criminal background checks for employment screening return clean results) approximately two months ago. The judge read a list of names and petition form types which had been granted and mine was on the list (which means now my eligibility for employment is the best it has ever been). I now feel more confident and less doubtful that I will be able to get hired if I apply for a job and then accept the resulting job offer (because now there is apparently no chance that the respective pre-employment background check will flag any criminal convictions (aside from job applications which I have submitted before 13_JUNE_2025 and which are still active)). I don't plan on dirtying up my record in the future with new misdemeanors nor with new felonies (and I also intend to avoid any less serious violations of government or of institutional policies). In other words, I hope and expect to keep my criminal background checks clean for now on (which means I don't plan on ever again committing any serious crimes).
